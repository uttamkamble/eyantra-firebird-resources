 Written by: Rohit Chauhan, NEX Robotics Pvt. Ltd.
 
 IDE: Keil uVision4
 Tool Chain: Realview MDK_ARM Ver 4.10
 C Compiler: ARMCC.exe

 Date: 1st OCT 2010
 
 This experiment demonstrates the simple operation of Buzzer ON/OFF with
 delay. Buzzer is connected to P0.25 of LPC2148

 Concepts covered:
 Output operation, generating delay

 Note:
 
 1. Make sure that in the Target options following settings are 
 	done for proper operation of the code

 	Microcontroller: LPC2148
 	Frequency: 12 Mhz
 	Create Hex File: Checked (For more information read section 4.3.1 "Setting up Project in Keil uVision" in the hardware manual)

 2. Ensure that following settings are done in Startup.s configuration wizard:

 	Clock Settings:
	
	PLL Steup	 >>	 MSEL=5, PSEL=2
	VPBDIV Setup >>  VPBCLK = CPU Clock/4
	
	For more details refer section 4.8 in the hardware manual.
